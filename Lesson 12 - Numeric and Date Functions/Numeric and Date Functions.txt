***** NUMERIC FUNCTIONS ******

- Numeric functions are functions that take numbers as an input. 

****** ROUND FUNCTION ******

- The round function rounds certain numbers. It takes two arguments:
1. The actual data / input number.
2. The amount of numbers behind the decimal point.

Example:
SELECT ROUND (10.888, 2) FROM DUAL; 

- The query from above will result in 10.89. 

- It is also possible to not enter the second argument. In that case, the number will be rounded to an Integer. 

Example:
SELECT ROUND (10.88888) FROM DUAL;

- The query from above will result in 11.

****** TRUNC FUNCTION ******

Example:
SELECT TRUNC (10.382348) FROM DUAL;

- The query from above will remove all numbers behind the decimal point. 

Example:
SELECT TRUNC (10.382348, 2) FROM DUAL;

- The query from above will remove all decimal numbers except the first two. 

****** SYSDATE / SYSTIMESTAMP FUNCTIONS ******

Example:
SELECT SYSDATE FROM DUAL;

- The example above returns the date of the system the database is running on. 

Example:
SELECT SYSTIMESTAMP FROM DUAL;

- The example from above will not only return the date of the system, but also the current time. 

****** ADD_MONTHS FUNCTION *******

Example: 
SELECT add_months('01/01/1990', 5)FROM dual;

- The example from above will add 5 months to the input date. 

****** MONTHS_BETWEEN FUNCTION ******

Example:
SELECT MONTHS_BETWEEN('01/01/1990', '01/01/1985') FROM DUAL;

- The example from above will return the month difference between both input dates. The result of tis example will be: 60.

****** TRUNC FUNCTION FOR DATES ******

- We can use the TRUNC function for dates. We can remove the months or years, NOT the days!

- BE AWARE! It still shows the days, months and years. If the input date is 05-11-1990 and we remove the months, it will return 01-11-1990. It goes to the first
available day in the month. If we do the same for year, it will return: 01-01-1990. It will go to the first available date in that particular year.   

Example:
SELECT TRUNC(hiredate, 'year') FROM emp;

- So how is this useful? Well, if we want to display only employees that are hired in a certain year, we could use this query:

Example:
SELECT ename, hiredate, TRUNC(hiredate, 'month') from emp WHERE trunc(hiredate, 'year') = '01/01/1982';
