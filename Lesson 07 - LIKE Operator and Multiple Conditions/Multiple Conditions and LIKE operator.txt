****** ORDERING CONDITIONS ******

- Always remember that OR divides the complete condition.

Example: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE sal > 3000 AND deptno = 10 OR job = 'MANAGER' AND comm > 100;
The conditions above are: (sal > 3000 AND deptno = 10) OR (job = 'MANAGER' AND comm > 100);

- As you can see above, the OR keyword divides the complete condition in two conditions. 


****** LIKE OPERATOR ******

- We can use the LIKE operator for the following: 

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job LIKE 'S%';

- This means we will get all records where the job starts with an S. The % operator is 
a wildcard. It says the job needs to start with an 'S' but it doesn't matter what comes next. 

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job LIKE '%E';  --> this means the job title has to end with an E but
it doesn't matter what becomes before the E. 


****** ASSIGNMENT ******

1. Return those employees that are salesman and that make either 300 dollars in commision
or greater than 1000 in commission. 

SOLUTION: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job = 'SALESMAN' AND (comm = 300 OR comm > 1000);
