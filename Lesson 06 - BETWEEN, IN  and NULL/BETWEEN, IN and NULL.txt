****** IN KEYWORD ******

- The IN keyword is used if the record needs to meet to multiple requirments. 
for example: We are looking for employees with the job title of 'MANAGER' and 'SALESMAN'.
We can write this down like: job = 'MANAGER or job = 'SALESMAN', or we can write:
job IN ('MANAGER', 'SALESMAN').

Example query: 
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job IN ('MANAGER', 'SALESMAN');


****** NOT IN KEYWORDS ******

- If we don't want the records to have a job title as manager or salesman, we can use the NOT IN keywords.

Example query:
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job NOT IN ('MANAGER', 'SALESMAN');


****** DATES IN SQL ******

- Dates in SQL are always written between single quotes. 



****** BETWEEN OPERATOR ******

- With the BETWEEN operator, we can select records that meet certain requirments between certain values. 

Example:
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE sal BETWEEN 1500 AND 2000;

- IMPORTANT: the BETWEEN operator works inclusive. So it is >= 1500 and <= 2000;


****** NOT BETWEEN OPERATOR ******

- We can also use the NOT BETWEEN operator, to retrieve all data around a certain condition. 

Example:
SELECT * FROM WHERE sal NOT BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000;


****** EMPTY CELLS ******

- NULL means that there is no data available for a certain cell. 

- If we want to select records that have a NULL value in a certain cell we also have to use the IS keyword. 

Eample: 
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE comm IS NULL;

- We can also use IS NOT NULL.

Example:
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE comm IS NOT NULL;


****** ASSIGNMENT ******

1. Write a query that presents all employees with a salary between 1000 and 2000.

SOLUTION: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE sal BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000;

2. Write a query that returns those employees that don't make any commision and have a salary greater than 1100 but less than 5000. Exclude those employees that have a salary equal to 3000. 

SOLUTION: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE (comm IS NULL OR comm = 0) AND sal != 3000 AND sal BETWEEN 1101 and 4999;
