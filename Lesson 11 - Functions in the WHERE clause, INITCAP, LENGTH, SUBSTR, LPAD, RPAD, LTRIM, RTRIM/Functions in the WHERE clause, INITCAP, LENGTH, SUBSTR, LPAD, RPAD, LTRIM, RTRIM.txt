****** SINGLE ROW FUNCTIONS IN THE WHERE CLAUSE ******

- In the lessons before, we used the SRF in the SELECT clause. This caused results to be returned in lower case, upper case or concatenated. 
- It is also possible to use SRF in the WHERE clause.

Example:
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job = LOWER('MANAGER');

- Since all job titles are written in upper case, this statement won't return any data because there is no match. SQL will search for 'manager' because
of the LOWER SRF.

****** SINGLE ROW CHARACTER FUNCTIONS / OTHER FUNCTIONS ******

- The functions we learned until now are single row character functions. This is because we are refering to characters, making them upper case, lower case or
concatenated. 

- There are also numeric functions, date functions, null functions, etc....

****** INITCAP FUCNTION *******

Example:
SELECT INITCAP('hello my name is martijn') from DUAL;

- The example above will return: "Hello My Name Is Martijn". It returns the scentence with all first letters capitalized.

****** LENGTH FUNCTION ******

Example:
SELECT length(ename) as NameLength FROM emp;

- The example above will return the length of each name.  

****** SUBSTR FUNCTION ******

- The substring function has three arguments. 
1. The String.
2. Starting position of the extraction.
3. The number of characters that we want to extract. 

Example:
SELECT substr ('hello', 2, 2) FROM dual;

- The result will be: 'el'. It starts on the 2nd character and it returns a maximum of 2 characters. 

- We can also leave the last number out. This means we will start at character 2 until the end.

****** LPAD and RPAD FUNCTIONS ******

- With the LPAD and RPAD functions, we can "pad" certain Strings. 

Example:
SELECT LPAD ('Hello', 10, '$') FROM DUAL; 

- The result of the query above will be: $$$$$Hello. This function will make the value larger until 10 characters with '$'.

Example
SELECT RPAD ('Hello', 10, '$') FROM DUAL;

- The result of the query above will be: Hello$$$$$. It does the same thing but on the right side.

****** LTRIM and RTRIM FUNCTIONS ******

Example: 
SELECT LTRIM('hhhhhhhhhello', 'h') FROM DUAL;

- The query above will remove all the 'h' characters from the left. 

Example:
SELECT RTRIM ('helloHHHHHHHH', 'H') FROM DUAL;

- The query above will remove all the 'H' characters from the right.
