****** WHERE keyword ******

- The WHERE keyword can be used to filter data on certain levels. 

- Example of statement: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job = 'MANAGER';

- The = operator means "is equal to". Different than in Java where you have to use two == operators. 

- VERY IMPORTANT: SQL is not case sensitive, but if we refer to data, we need to be exact. If we are
looking for employees with the JOB equal to MANAGER, we can't write it with lower cases. If we do that, no data
will be found.  

- Strings in SQL are written between single quotes, not double ones like in Java. 

****** AND / OR keywords ******

- The AND keyword can be used to select multiple conditions. 

- Example of statement (job and salary): SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job = 'MANAGER' AND sal = 1600; 

- We cannot use the AND keyword wordt multiple job titles.

- Not working and WRONG statement would be: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job = 'MANAGER' AND job = 'SALESMAN'; 
This doesn't work since no employee has the role of 'MANAGER' AND 'SALESMAN'. We have to use the OR keyword
to get all the managers and salesmen. 

- The correct statement would be: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job = 'MANAGER' OR job = 'SALESMAN';
