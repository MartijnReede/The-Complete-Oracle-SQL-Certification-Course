****** OR KEYWORD ******

- For example: if we want to find all employees with the job title 'SALESMAN' or 'CLERK'
we cannot use the AND keyword. This is because one employee cannot have the title SALESMAN and CLERK.
It is either a clerk or salesman, not both. This is where we use the OR keyword. 

- Example for a correct statement: SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job = 'SALESMAN' OR job = 'CLERK';

****** ASSIGNMENT ******

1. Get the names of the employees that are not managers, nor salesman and have a salary
greater than or equal to 2000;

SOLUTION:
SELECT ename FROM emp WHERE job != 'MANAGER' AND job != 'SALESMAN' AND sal >= 2000;

2. Get the names and hiring dates of those employees that work in dalas or chicago. 
SELECT ename, hiredate FROM emp WHERE deptno = 20 OR deptno = 30;
