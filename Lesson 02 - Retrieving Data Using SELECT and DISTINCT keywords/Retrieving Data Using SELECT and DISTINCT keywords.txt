- Sometimes tables are called objects in SQL. Objects can be much more than only tables. 

- The SQL language is not case sensitive.
- A SQL statement is made up of keywords.

****** THE SELECT KEYWORD ******

To retrieve data we can use the SELECT and FROM keywords: 
- SELECT --> <column>
- FROM   --> <table>

- Example of statement: SELECT job(column) FROM employees(table);
- Example statement with two columns: SELECT job, ename FROM employees;
- * Operator: will return all of the columns. 
- Example with using the * operator: SELECT * FROM employees;

- We can only run one statement at a time. We can type in more statements at the same time, but we have to divide them
with semicolons. 

****** THE DISTINCT KEYWORD ******

- If we use the distinct keyword, we will only get the unique values from the database. 
- Example of DISTINCT query: SELECT DISTINCT job FROM emp;


****** ASSIGNMENT ******

Write a quary that retrieves only the DEPARTMENT_NAME and LOCATION from the departments table.

Solution: SELECT dname, loc FROM DEPT;
